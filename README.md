# Mini Product Discovery Page

## Time Spent
 I spent about **2 hours and 30 minutes** to complete this project. I focused on keeping the design **simple, meaningful**, and functional rather than making it overly complex. The goal was to make it clean and understandable.

 ## What Iâ€™d Improve With More Time
 - Add smooth **animations and transitions** to enhance user interaction.
 - Implement **question categories** or levels (easy, medium, hard).
 - Integrate **score tracking or progress bar** during the quiz.
